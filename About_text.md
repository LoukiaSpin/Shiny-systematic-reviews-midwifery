## Introducing the Research Fingerprint dashboard 

<img src="Logo_Hebammenwissenschaft.png" alt="Example" width="200" align="right">
<span style="font-size: 20px;">The Research Fingerprint was created as a response to the critically low methodological quality of non-Cochrane reviews on randomised controlled studies investigating hyoscine butylbromide for labour duration. The dashboard aims to communicate our research results comprehensively and transparently, and raise awareness about the evidence quality on that topic. All visualisations offer interactivity by placing the mouse cursor on the plots to view the details, such as numbers and text.</span>

### Quality summary 

<span style="font-size: 20px;">It provides a dashboard that summarises the quality of the retrieved systematic reviews based on three dimensions: (i) the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal instrument, (ii) their reporting and methodological transparency (yes/no), targeting protocol availability, mentioning the PRISMA statement, assessing the risk of bias of the involved studies and reporting the GRADE assessment results, and (iii) the comprehensiveness of the literature searches concerning the databases.</span>
