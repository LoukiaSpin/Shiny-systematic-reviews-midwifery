<span style="font-size: 20px;">The <strong>Research Fingerprint</strong> was created as a response to the critically low methodological quality of non-Cochrane reviews on randomised controlled studies investigating hyoscine butylbromide for labour duration.</span> 
<br><br>

<span style="font-size: 20px;">The dashboard aims to communicate our research results comprehensively and transparently, and raise awareness about the evidence quality on that topic.</span>   
<br><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">All visualisations offer interactivity by placing the mouse cursor on the plots to view the details, such as numbers and text.</span>
