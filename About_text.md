## Introducing the Research Fingerprint dashboard

<span style="font-size: 20px;">The published literature is under unprecedented proliferation in several clinical areas, regardless of study design [1].</span> 
<span style="font-size: 20px;">Systematic reviews, initially designed to inform clinicians and decision-makers about the numerous published clinical trials in their research area, 
have also experienced rapid growth in publications.</span> 
<span style="font-size: 20px;">When the research quantity reaches a sheer volume, concerns about the quality of the research findings arise [2].</span> 
<br><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">Reporting guidelines, such as the PRISMA 2020 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement [3], 
tools to assess the risk of bias in primary studies, such as Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 [4], and critical appraisal instruments, 
such as AMSTAR 2 (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews) [5], are collective responses to the accumulated evidence of questionable systematic reviews. 
Untrustworthy evidence can be harmful to the evidence ecosystem [1].</span>  
<br><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>So, what about the systematic reviews on labour duration?</strong></span> 
<br><br>
<span style="font-size: 20px;">We recently collected one Cochrane and seven non-Cochrane reviews on randomised controlled studies investigating hyoscine butylbromide for labour duration [6]. 
We extracted the PICO (Participants, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome) characteristics that defined their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the databases used for the literature searches, 
any guidelines considered for reporting and critical appraisal, and their AMSTAR 2 methodological confidence score.</span>

<span style="font-size: 20px;">The <strong>Research Fingerprint</strong> dashboard presents the results of our meta-research study using graphical illustrations, featuring eight systematic reviews. 
Our goal is to communicate our research results comprehensively and transparently, and raise awareness about the quality of systematic reviews on this topic. 
A great feature of the dashboard is that all visualisations offer interactivity, allowing users to view details, such as numbers and text, by placing the mouse cursor on the graphs.</span>
